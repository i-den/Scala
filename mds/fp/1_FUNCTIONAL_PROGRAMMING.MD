### Terms

#### Calculation
Calculations are computations from input to output.
They always give the same output when you give them the same input.
You can call them anytime, anywhere, and it won’t affect anything outside of them.
That makes them really easy to test and safe to use without worrying about how many times or when they are called.

#### Action
Anything that depends on when it is run, or how many times it is run, or both, is an action.
If I send an urgent email today, it’s much different from sending it next week.
And of course, sending the same email 10 times is different from sending it 0 times or 1 time.

#### Data
Data is recorded facts about events.
We distinguish data because it is not as complex as executable code.
It has well-understood properties.
Data is interesting because it is meaningful without being run.
It can be interpreted in multiple ways.
Take a restaurant receipt as an example: It can be used by the restaurant manager to determine which food items are popular.
And it can be used by the customer to track their dining-out budget.

#### Techniques
- copy-on-write
- defensive copying

Recursion instead of Loops
Immutables
